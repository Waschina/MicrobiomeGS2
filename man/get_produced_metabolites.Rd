\usage{
get_produced_metabolites(mod, easyConstraints = NULL, multi.thread = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{Model object of class `modelorg`}

\item{easyConstraints}{Additional constraints. See easyConstraints in the sybil
documentation.}

\item{multi.thread}{logical. Indicating if parallel processing of models is
used.}
}
\value{
data.table with predicted production rate and flux ranges. Columns: `ex` - exchange reaction ID,
`rxn.name` - exchange reaction name, `l` - lower bound of reaction flux, `u` - upper bound, `mtf.flux` - predicted production flux.
}
\description{
Predicts metabolite production using MTF-FBA and FVA.
}
\details{
Ranges (`l` & `u`) are based on a FVA-derived method. This method attempts to prevent cases where a
nutrient is taken up from the environment, transformed to another compound that is produced, but without any
contribution to the organism's growth rate. When providing additional
constraints, please note that these constraints are not (yet) applied for the
flux variability analysis.
